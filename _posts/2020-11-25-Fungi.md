title: Learning About Fungi
---

## Preface
To be fair, I've been aware that fungi are distinct from plants for a long time. Their exact differences are a lot more murky in my mind. My understanding before doing any research is this:
* Fungi are genetically further from plants than humans. 
* Fungi have different energy sources than plants.
### Questions
1. What defines a fungus?
2. How did fungi evolve and differentiate?
3. How do fungi grow?
4. What are intriguing points of diversity within this grouping of organisms?

## A Fungus, Many Fungi

## Fungal Phylogenies

## Energy :zap:
