# Disclaimer
I do know a fair amount about a lot of these topics. Dear reader, this disclaimer is necessary because I don't want to be taken for an idiot. 
I plan to make a blog post about all of these, but here's the ongoing list:
1. Earth's rotation, tilt, etc. 
2. Fungi
3. Internet (mainly WiFi, but also a deeper understanding of servers)
4. Cars
5. Flight
6. Optics, glasses, sight beyond the human visible light spectrum
7. Groundwater
8. Bluetooth (this may resolve itself in the WiFi post)
9. Mechanisms behind alcohol and marijuana
10. Barcodes
11. Bomb-sniffing dogs
12. Credit card strips
13. Moon's influence over tides
14. Cows sensing the Earth's magnetic field
15. Clouds
